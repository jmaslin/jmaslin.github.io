* I am a self-taught web developer who is always working on new projects.
* My favorite type of pie is [Raspberry Pi][rpi].
* I took a selfie with Alexis Ohanian when he was on his book tour - we both showed off our Pebble watches!
* The CIO of a major company once personally called me.
* I know how to use Microsoft Word (wink wink, recruiters).

For more information, please download my [resume][resume], check out my Github (some projects are private!), connect with me on LinkedIn, tweet me, or send a good old fashioned email.
