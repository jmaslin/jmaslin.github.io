# Hello, internet.

I have decided to rebuild my website and blog using the [Jekyll framework][jekyll]. My old site was built on [Wordpress][wordpress], which is a bit heavy for what I need to do. Hosting this website on [my Github page][mygit] allows me to do the following.
<ul>
	<li>Securely update it from anywhere.</li>
	<li>Avoid using an unncessary database.</li>
	<li>Save money by using Github's hosting.</li>
</ul>

Plus, since the site is a git project, I can easily grab the latest version from whatever workstation I am using, and work offline. Over the next few weeks I plan on giving the site a facelift and adding more content, including links to my current web projects.

Stay tuned!
