### What is your endgoal?

This past week, I attended the career fair at Drexel University. The event was Hunger Games themed and had the tagline "May the jobs be ever in your favor." Before it started there was a line down the block. Much like the movie, everyone wanted to get to the "good tables" first.

Drexel Students of all ages and majors showed up. Some were prepared with their portfolio of résumés and nicely fitting suits; others wore ill-fitting jackets and flashy watches that were either borrowed, fake, or both.

As a sophomore, I am not exactly looking for a full-time position, so I went in with an open mind and my website on my nametag.

One of the first companies I talked to was [PPL Corporation][ppl], a giant energy company in the Fortune 500. The recruiter told me that most employees of PPL stay for a long time. When I asked him if there is room to grow, he told me they use an internal system that employees can use to look for promotions in the company. This was meant to sound exciting, but waiting in a queue for a management position is something I am interested in.

I do not want to work for a company where there is a possibility you can move up the "corporate ladder" over 5-25 years. Another company I talked to told me they had a two year training program you participate in as you work full-time. The recruiter told me they invest a lot of time and energy into employees because most are planning on working for that company their whole life. *One company their entire life.*

Maybe that works for some people, but I cannot count myself as one of them. I enjoy new, constant challenges and learning as I go. The startup atmosphere is very appealing to me because no one can be certain if it will be successful or not. I want to work with passionate people who know something will only succeeed due to their effort. I am not saying there are no passionate people in big companies, but the average employee is not as pressured to innovate. There is also too much *routine.* Doing the same thing everyday would drive me crazy. 

Most people get a job with their endgoal in mind. Some want to work for one company, contribute to their IRA every year, and retire at 65 to a condo in Florida. Others want to do something that excites and challenges them, live in the moment, and retire when they feel they have accomplished their goals.

I do not care if your company has thousands of employees globally or provides everyone with an iPhone every 2 years. I want to work for a company where the energy level is high, everyone has crazy ideas, and the endgoal is always evolving. I want to work for a company where recruiters do not have to wear fancy suits because what the company does is impressive enough. And as much as I love cookies, I do not want to work for a cookie-cutter company that promotes people on a schedule and has corner offices as a status symbol.

Parachutes are necessary in life, but we define ourselves when we pull the chute. As a young, motivated college student, I like to think I will not have to pull mine for a while.
