Here are the latest programming projects I have been working on.

<ul class="portfolio">
	<li>
		<h3>Coopswitch</h3>
		<p class="post-meta"><strong>Established</strong> November 2013 | <strong>First Git Commit</strong> May 2014 | <strong>Currently</strong> In Progress</p>

		<p class="post-meta"><strong>Development</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> were used as the backend for this project. Instead of using a framework, I decided start from scratch in order to develop a greater understanding of the language.</li>
			<li><strong>Twitter's Bootstrap</strong> framework, which consists of <strong>HTML, CSS, </strong>and <strong>Javascript</strong> classes was used for the majority of the frontend UI/UX. I also implemented some custom <strong>JQuery</strong> which was used for certain design elements and submitting <strong>AJAX</strong> requests.</li>
			<li>This project is hosted on a small Digital Ocean<strong> VPS</strong> and is protected with a <strong>SSL</strong> script and passwordless auth via <strong>SSH</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />

		<p class="post-meta"><strong>About</strong></p>
		<p>Coopswitch is my first major web project and was created to solve the issue of switching co-op cycles at Drexel University.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Merecraft</h3>
		<p class="post-meta">Established April 2013</p>
		<p>Merecraft is a small community based around the popular game Minecraft. Besides founding the server, I helped grow the community, code custom Java plugins, and perform server maintenance.
